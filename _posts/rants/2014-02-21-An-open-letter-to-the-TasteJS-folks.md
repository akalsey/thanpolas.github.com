**Disclamer** I am a great fan and admirer of the work and contributions done by the TasteJS team both as a team and each one member individually. I have benefited both personally and professionally from your work and it is your commitment to the community that motivates me whenever i'm in need for inspiration.

Now that said, TasteJS folks, you are out of line. The [Yet Another Framework Syndrome][yafs] post, provided some really useful and practical advice into authoring Open Source Software and tried to tunnel some of the collective development power into more constructive and practical applications. The title of the post however was unfortunate to say the least. I am not a native English speaker but this title reads pompous and snob. It's not the title itself that uneased me but the notion that the community should stop trying to re-invent the wheel and move on, said in a really prickly way.

Unless you folks believe humans were made from clay, YAFS is a very misplaced statement. It is the continuous trial & error that has gotten us to where we are today. If folks took your advice, we'd still be using Lycos, Hotbot and Yahoo's Internet directory today. But you see, this argument could be made against any random grumpy old Joe that said "*Bah, you new hippies think you hold the world by the balls*". But this is not the case here.

TasteJS is a constitution among the Javascript community. It is one of the 4 things you mention when asked "What summarizes the JS Community?". You have a great responsibility, everyone's looking up to you and idealizes you, sets you as an example. All things considered, the TodoMVC project, which became TasteJS afterwards, played a great part into bringing you to the forefronts of the JS community. Today, you simply have to operate at a different level of responsibility than what you used to. You say to the JS community "JUMP" everyone asks "HOW HIGH".

But it's not just that.

One cannot start a poetry group, become a worldwide success and then write an article "The Yet Another Poet Syndrome". It's tasteless! It's insulting and shows of a man/woman who holds no regard or respect for their peers.

I start a comedy club, become the most prominent comedy club in the world and then i'm tweeting "*Everyone's a fucking comedian*". It's not funny. Ok maybe that was, but not in your case. You, the constitution representative, simply cannot make these statements. EVERYONE else CAN; but not you.

The Browserify author cannot call RequireJS a piece of junk! The Ember folks cannot say the Angular dudes don't know what they are talking about! You just cannot do that, it's inappropriate.

There was [noticeable][reddit yafs] [criticism][reddit post] for the YAFS post when it came out, including [myself][thanpolas tweet] being part of that. While at the time i felt like this (post) answer should be made, i didn't go forward because i understand that humans make mistakes and it's ok. But then, today, three weeks after the YAFS post, i saw this tweet from a TasteJS member:

![TasteJS Twitter Convo for YAFS](/assets/img/twitter-yafs-convo.jpg)

This is not personal, it's not about who tweeted what, what i want to illustrate here, is the belief among the TasteJS team that indeed people should stop doing what they like to do. Which is the reason the TasteJS exists in the first place!?¡☯¿

So, TasteJS folks, if you are tired of doing the job that the community expects you to do, then please stop doing it. Stop accepting applications. Do whatever gives you joy and pleasure and satisfies your need for the next challenge. But please, respect the same need for a challenge other people have, it just happens to be a framework.
