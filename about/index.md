![Thanasis Polychronakis](/assets/img/thanpolas-circle-grey.png) Hi! My name is Thanasis Polychronakis, I am a thirty+ web developer passionate about technology, entrepreneurship and shiny objects. I live and work in Athens, Greece as a freelance web developer.

I am passionate about Startups and have been involved with more than a few[^startups]. I am sharing my experiences [on my entrepreneurial blog](http://20minus.com); so that hopefully you won't make the same mistakes I did. ![coding weapons](/assets/img/coding-weapons.png)

I love building tools that help startups move from idea to product faster. Have a look at my [open source projects](/projects) or check out my [technical blog](/blog) where I talk about web technologies, staff I worked on and experiences gained.


[^startups]: [geowarp.com](http://geowarp.com) and [boothchat.com](http://boothchat.com) are startups I have founded and failed -*Beware* not maintained-. [PeoplePerHour](http://peopleperhour.com) and [Verbling](http://verbling.com) are few of the startups I helped move forward.
