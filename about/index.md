![Thanasis Polychronakis :: thanpolas](/assets/img/thanpolas-circle-grey.png) Hi! My name is Thanasis Polychronakis, I am a thirty-ish web developer passionate about  technology, entrepreneurship and shiny objects. I live and work in Athens, Greece as a freelance web developer.

I've been involved with many startups [^eyersee][^geowarp][^boothchat] in the far and recent past. I am sharing my experiences and skills [on my entrepreneurial blog](http://20minus.com); so that hopefully you won't make the same mistakes I did. ![coding weapons](/assets/img/coding-weapons.png)

I love building tools that help new startups get faster from paper to product. Have a look at my [open source projects](/projects) or check out my [blog](/blog) where I talk about web technologies, staff I worked on and experiences gained. Feel free to email me at [thanpolas@gmail.com](mailto:thanpolas@gmail.com).


[^eyersee]: [eyersee.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20040902120829/http://helpchan.und.eyersee.org/) (offline) was the first startup I co-founded. Me and my friends were working on the idea from 98 but it was not until 2000 that we committed full time. eyersee.org allowed each chat channel, of every IRC network, to have a personalized webpage with forums, bulletin boards, own members etc etc...

[^geowarp]: In 2009 I founded [geowarp.com](http://geowarp.com), a service that enables users to save their favorite locations and access them from mobile and web. -*Beware* not maintained-

[^boothchat]: [boothchat.com](http://boothchat.com) was the last startup i co-founded, a photo chatting service that allows users to create their own chat room and have a photo snapped from their webcam each time they type something. -*Beware* not maintained-
