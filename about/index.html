<p>My last full-time job was at <a href="http://peopleperhour.com">peopleperhour.com</a> where I built a visitor tracking system that allowed the service to store arbitrary information for every visitor that came to the site. Enabling the administration to have a crystal clear picture of the lifetime of their users and detailed conversion rates. The system used Amazon's <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">DynamoDB</a> for which I had to develop special drivers to interface with.</p>

<p>I've cofounded three startups in the past. <i><strong>Eyersee.org</strong></i> (offline) was my first startup that I co-founded back in 2000, it was a "<i>geocities</i>" type of service for the IRC community. <i><strong><a href="http://geowarp.com">geowarp.com</a></strong></i> a service that enables users to save their favorite locations and access them from mobile and web. <i><strong><a href="http://boothchat.com">boothchat.com</a></strong></i> a photo chatting service.</p>
